Name: Jessie Wu

Tools used: 
* Font Awesome for some quick icons
* Plain ol vanilla Javascript

Editor used: Sublime 3

Time taken: 12 hours

TODO's: 
* figure out why that random thin solid border is needed to maintain the two-column layout
* revert divs back to aside and section/article elements. I originally started with html5 elements but they weren't styling properly so I changed into regular divs.
* vertically stretch the two column divs to be the same height and have a line dividing both sections
* animate a slow toggle for the mobile nav bar (DONE with CSS transition + javascript adding height, + 30 mins)
* fix the responsiveness for all desktop screen sizes (DONE with viewport meta, + 30 mins)
